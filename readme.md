1. Addition - (+)
   Subtraction - (-)
   Multiplication - (*)
   Division - (/)

2. (=), (+=), (-=), (*=), (/=)


3. (==), (===), (!=), (!==), (>), (<), (>=), (<=>)

4. (&&), (||), (!)

5. (&), (|), (^), (~), (<<), (>>), (>>>)


2.
  Aritmetic operators: 
  - let x = 5;
    let y = 3;
    let z = x + y;

  - let a = 5;
    let b = 4;
    let c = a*b;

  Assignment operators:
  - x += y;
  - x -=y;

  Comparison operators:
  - if (age < 16) text = "Too young to buy drive";
  - if (age > 18) text = "old enough to drink alcohol";

  Logical Operators:
  Using x = 4 and y = 6,
  - (x < 5 && y>4) is true
  - (x == 5 || y == 5) is false

  Bitwise operators:
  - 5 & 1 which gives 1
  - 5 ^ 1 which gives 4

4. The result will be 1, 8 and finally 15.
